There are 2 types of distributions:
1.) Zipped - a zipped archive of files that you simply unzip into a
             directory. To run the program, go to that directory and 
             double click APMD5.jar file.
             
2.) Installer - The installer is made with IzPack.  This installer is a 
                Java jar file and will take you through a wizard to install
                the application with shortcuts and an uninstaller. Just 
                double-click the jar file to start installing.
